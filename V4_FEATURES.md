# Estimated list of changes in the V4

* Front app is no longer included.
* To watch serious and to watch background are merged.
* True REST APIs:
  * endpoint are reflecting ressources and no longer screens ;
  * using HTTP verbs instead of different endpoints for each action.
* Games are no longer duplicated (one entry per platform). We link them to the platforms instead.
* We can now see if a game is completed or entirely watched. Two new filters: "Finished" and "Not finished".
