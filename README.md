## Description :notebook:

A personal educational test project to manage my video games collection. Games can be sorted by support,
todo list, watch list, ranking...

## Utilization

* In dev mode: just do a __docker compose up__. In production, make your gunicorn server to launch the application __app.py__.

* An empty database is given in the repository: just import it.

* Once the application is running, go to __/register__ to create an account.

* Then go to your database to enable the user you just created. That's it.

## Stack :light_rail:

* Docker
* Nginx
* Gunicorn
* Python 3.7
* Flask
* Jinja 2
* Circle CI
